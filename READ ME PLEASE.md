# Kerridge-Job-Search-Site


Hi!

The site itself has some quirks that were necessary to produce a demonstration-ready product, and don't readily show themselves. Here they are:

1) when looking at the 'contact us' section, only TWO locations will actually load anything from the drop down menus - Houston, Texas and Gateshead, UK. Selecting anywhere else will NOT load anything.
2) The text entry fields 'work' but don't actually save anything
3) 'Log In' on the login page will take you straight to the user profile page regardless of any text entry
4) On the 'Look for Jobs' page, the 'refine search' button will load a new page with some 'search results' regardless of the options chosen above. That being said, all the results are for permanent, full time positions.

I think that's it.
