# Job Search Site

> *School project to create a job searching website for Kerridge Commercial Solutions. This repo is not actually associated with the company in any way and any usage of their logo/materials/information is purely to make it look more realistic.*

Current code types implemented:

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [ ] Javascript

## Current Status:

*Project complete to assignment spec, however further work is ongoing.*

> The site itself has some quirks that were necessary to produce a demonstration-ready product, and don't readily show themselves. Here they are:
>
> - When looking at the 'contact us' section, only TWO locations will actually load anything from the drop down menus - Houston, Texas and Gateshead, UK. Selecting anywhere else will NOT load anything.
> - The text entry fields 'work' but don't actually save anything
> - The 'Log In' button on the login page will take you straight to the user profile page regardless of any text entry
> - On the 'Look for Jobs' page, the 'refine search' button will load a new page with some 'search results' regardless of the options chosen above. That being said, all the results are for permanent, full time positions.

## To Do:

- [ ] Add modal functionality for 'sign up' and request 'password reset buttons'
- [ ] Investigate and implement backend functionality for storage of user information
